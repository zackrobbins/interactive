    <h1>Reading response D</h1>


    <h1>Comments on an excerpt from Tauba Auerbach’s<i><a href="http://veryinteractive.net/content/4-library/56-perseverence/auerbach-p-e-r-s-e-v-e-r-e.pdf" target="_blank">(P)(e)(r)(s)(e)(r)(v)(e)(r)(e)</a></i></h1>




    <p><strong alt="Brice Wilner">TA</strong> The progress
is obvious but also quite different from what I expected.</p>

    <p><strong alt="Zack Robbins">ZR</strong> I find Tauba's way of writing and a few of her statements to be meditative and poignant. I like the idea that by participating in a sort of daily practice, there is a certain initial intent, but over thousands of repetitions the practice might lead deeper questions. That in the act of doing, questions about purpose, direction and being might surface. I also like that this might pertain to life decisions, what is being said in a person’s work. It might allow time to ponder how and why someone is saying something. The unexpected results to me are also of particular interest. Mainly that I believe these paths emerge intuitively as an artists relfects and evolves.
