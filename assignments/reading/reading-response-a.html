    <p><strong alt="Brice Wilner">BW</strong> My experience before coming here was that I really enjoyed the site’s energy. I did notice that it gives a good overview of what graphic design at Yale is like, but that’s only one of the four graduate majors. I often wonder what other departments’ experience of the site is because I don’t see as many sculptors, photographers, and painters.</p>

    <p><strong alt="Zack Robbins">ZR</strong> I was kind of wondering, on Bryce's point, if it also successfully embodies the practices of other disciplines? I think it does a great job as far communicating relevant information and then also offering design students to engage, or it reveals something about graphic design. But do other students engage, does it reveal something about photographic or sculptural practices?
