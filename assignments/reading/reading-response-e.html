    <h2>"Ashley Madison was a massive, centralized agglomeration of indiscretion."</h2>
    
    <p>It's interesting to think about how morality (however that might be defined) and internet ethics are tied together.</p>
    
    <p>I understand that it is important to have a decentralized internet for maintaining its presence (like as a backup or like a community can't exist with out various members). Is it important that the internet is always decentralized? Should that be a rule?</p>
